# Understanding Bites Protocol & Impedance Information Integration

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on reverse engineering the Bites Protocol utilized by a Bluetooth Smart Scale. The primary goal is to comprehend the data exchange mechanism between the smart scale and its corresponding application. Additionally, it implements the integration of impedance information, enhancing the scale's functionality.

## Key Features:
1. **Reverse Engineering Bites Protocol:**
   - In-depth analysis of the communication protocol used by the Bluetooth Smart Scale.
   - Understanding the structure and format of data packets exchanged between the scale and the application.
   - Deciphering the meaning of each data field for weight, body composition, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Impedance Information Integration:**
   - Implementation of impedance measurement capability into the existing system.
   - Incorporating impedance data into the data packets exchanged during communication.
   - Calibration and validation of impedance measurements to ensure accuracy and reliability.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Using algorithms to process raw data received from the scale and impedance sensors.
